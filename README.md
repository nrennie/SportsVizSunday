# Sports Viz Sunday

Sports Viz Sunday is a place for people to combine two of the greatest things in the world: sports and data. Each month, a new dataset is released for people to pull insights out of and share in the form of data visualisation. Details of the monthly challenges can be found [here](https://www.sportsvizsunday.com/).

This repository contains the R code used to produce my visualisations. You can follow my attempts on Twitter: [@nrennie35](https://twitter.com/nrennie35).
